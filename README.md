# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

![Trained Agents][image1]

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program.  

## Table of Contents

### Installation

This repository is quite sensible to package version.
* You need Python 3.8.x (not that I couldn't make it waork on Python 3.9 at the date of creation of this file)
* Then you need to clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bedlopie/NanoDegree-DRL.git
```
* I would advise you to use a virtual environement to make sure all is well installed and isolated from the rest of your machine, don't forget to upgrade pip
```bash
python -m venv drlnd
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
* Then pip install the requirement.txt file in this directory
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Then, you need to install another set of package
```bash
pip install -r ./deep-reinforcement-learning/python/requirements.txt
```
* And last create the Kernel to run all of this, you need to set jupyter to use this kernel instead of the default one
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

Then you can go in project 1 - 2 - 3 to run the projects

### How to use the project

**The projects are all built the same way.**
You have 3 files
1. *.ipynb         / file to run project (ie. Continuous_Control.ipynb)
2. model.py        / file containing the Deep Neural Network model 
3. ddpg_agent.py   / file containing the agent in charge of acting on the environement

model and agent file have been setup and fine tune.
you need to go in the ipynb file to run the project.

#### Demo vs Training mode

in cell 2, you have a "demo" variable. Set it to True to view save model and to False to train a model

#### Training

set up hyperparameters of agent and model in cell number 8, by modifying the dictonary called hyperparameters
Checkpoints are created along the way. One for critic network and one for actor
* checkpoint_cc_critic_##.pth         ## being the average score value obtained in training
* checkpoint_cc_critic_solved.pth     checkpoint created when problem is considered solved
* checkpoint_cc_critic_max.pth        checkpoint created when training is finished (might not be the best)
